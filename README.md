# Autosplitters

Autosplitters are used to automatically control [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit) based on the value of specified memory address pointers. This allows for starting, splitting, and resetting to be performed without any user input. To use these autosplitters, select an applicable game in the livesplit ```Edit Splits``` menu, and then click the ```Activate``` button to activate the autosplitter.
